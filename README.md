The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline using Python to extract and transform campaign data. The starting data is contained in two files that were provided by EdX:<br>
<br>
A file containing contacts:<br>
https://github.com/Adam-Kertz/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Resources/contacts.xlsx<br>
and a file containing additional campaign data:<br>
https://github.com/Adam-Kertz/Crowdfunding_ETL/blob/main/Resources/crowdfunding.xlsx<br>
<br>
The following python file is used to transform the data:<br>

*comments within the above file provide detailed descriptions of the types of transformations performed<br>
<br>
The above python code produces the following 4 csv files:<br>
<br>
General Crowdfunding Campaign Info:<br>

A Table of Crowdfunding Catagories:<br>

A Table of Crowdfunding Subcategories:<br>

Important Contact Information:<br>

The database was created using the following schematic design<br>

Exporting the above diagram produced the following import code<br>
